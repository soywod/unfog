## [1.0.0] - 2020-08-14

The args parser becomes more solid (based on
[optparse](https://github.com/pcapriotti/optparse-applicative#custom-parsing-and-error-handling)
lib). The due time is simplified and normalized (using ISO notation instead of
custom one), since it's not considered as a  main feature. Tags are replaced by
project. A project is just a unique tag (or a simple category). The aim of
those changes is to simplify the usage of Unfog, and to focus on the core
concept (create tasks, attach tasks to projects, start/stop tasks, check
reports).
